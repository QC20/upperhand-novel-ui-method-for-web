# UpperHand: Hand Gesture Interaction for the Web

UpperHand is a groundbreaking project that delves into the realm of hand gesture interaction, allowing users to control a UI app through intuitive hand movements. Inspired by advancements in machine learning (ML), particularly the use of hand detection algorithms, UpperHand aims to bridge the gap between technology and human interaction.

## What is UpperHand?

UpperHand is a web-based tool that enables users to experiment with hand gesture interactions effortlessly. Developed as a personal project by Jonas Kjeldmand Jensen, UpperHand goes beyond mere hand detection demos by empowering users to create their own interactions using hand gestures.

### 1. Novel Interactions:

UpperHand opens up a realm of possibilities for interaction design, allowing users to define triggers and reactions based on hand gestures. From simple actions like clicking to complex interactions, the potential for creativity is endless.

### 2. Design Considerations:

While hand gesture interaction may seem futuristic and exciting, it's crucial to consider its practical implications. Not all tasks are suitable for hand gestures, as prolonged use may lead to discomfort and fatigue. Designers must strike a balance between novelty and usability.

### 3. Categorizing Gestures:

Hand gestures come in various forms, from predefined poses to dynamic movements and finger relations. UpperHand categorizes gestures into three main types: poses, actions, and fingers, each serving a unique purpose in interaction design.

### 4. User Onboarding:

Introducing users to hand gesture interaction requires thoughtful onboarding strategies. Visual cues and gradual introductions to gestures can help users familiarize themselves with the new interaction paradigm, minimizing frustration and maximizing engagement.

### 5. Use Case Scenarios:

While hand gesture interaction may not be suitable for all devices, it shines in specific use case scenarios. From controlling large displays to enabling hands-free interactions during multitasking, UpperHand identifies the sweet spots where gesture interaction excels.

## Conclusion

UpperHand represents a leap forward in interaction design, offering users a glimpse into the future of human-computer interaction. By leveraging the power of hand gestures, UpperHand encourages exploration, creativity, and innovation in UI/UX design.
